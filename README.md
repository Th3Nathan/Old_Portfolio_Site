This is my portfolio page, everything on it is a work in progress. 

Next time I work on the page, I will optimize it by removing JavaScript blocks, minifying files, and allowing the browser to chose from several image files. 

The pages Th3Nathan.github.io/resume and Th3Nathan.github.io/game were built as projects for classes on Udacity, an online learning platform. 

The Th3Nathan.github.io/akari was made to demonstrate to a friend how a photography portfolio page for her might look. Code is functional but extremely messy. Currently planning that site.
