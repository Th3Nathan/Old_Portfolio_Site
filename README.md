The pages at Th3Nathan.github.io/resume and Th3Nathan.github.io/game were built as projects for classes on Udacity, an online learning platform. 

The Th3Nathan.github.io/akari was made to demonstrate to a friend how a photography portfolio page for her might look. This page only works on computer screens. 

Th3nathan.github.io/draft Is based on my friend's design. It is just a draft, waiting for more information before I proceed. It is responsive and uses viewport units for sizing as much as possible. 

Th3nathan.github.io/optim/views.pizza.js Had severe jank caused by Javascript. I made it more efficient. More detail on changes I made in the folder.
